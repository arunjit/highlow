# The High-Low game

This is the classic high-low game. A player has to guess a random number (the
secret) from a given range of numbers.

A player's guess must exactly match the secret to complete the game. A guess
can be "low" or "high", that is, smaller or greater than the secret. In this
case, a message, either "Low" or "High", is shown to the player.

The game can be played anonymously, but no stats will be saved.

If a player is logged in to the game, they can see how many guesses other
players used for the same secret number - and how many guesses a computer would
take to guess the number.
